# sitely
A local site creator that remembers the sites you create and the code in them - however, there are still bugs in it...

# About Sitely
Sitely uses local storage to allow users to create, view, and open sites. Sitely stores users' site names, site codes, and allows users
to open any of their sites at any time. The sites that a user has created can be viewed in the home screen in a table-format. Sitely also
allows users to delete sites at any time.

# Why Local Storage?
Sitely uses local storage as a way to store the code and name of any user-created site. The great thing about local storage is it
permanently saves the data on your computer until it is deleted. Even greater is that Sitely allows users to delete their sites,
saving computer space. However, local storage is extremely limited in that the site names cannot contain spaces or special characters
in them, etc. I am currently working to fix this bug using Javascript's replace.

# Is it Public?
Any sites created using Sitely can be viewed by anyone who uses your computer account. That means you cannot access the site from
another computer or from another account. However, you can close/open your sites in your computer account at any time without data
being lost, as it is saved locally. Local storage causes your site to be more private than public, as not everyone can view it, but you
can still view it at any time. Think of it as an alarm you set on an app, as you wouldn't want an alarm to turn off the moment you
closed the app.
